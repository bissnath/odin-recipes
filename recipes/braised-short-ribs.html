        <ul>
          <li>3 lbs beef short ribs</li>
          <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
          <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>For the Braise:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
          <li>2 carrots, diced</li>
          <li>2 celery stalks, diced</li>
          <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
          <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
          <li>2 cups red wine (e.g., Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot)</li>
          <li>2 cups beef stock</li>
          <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
          <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
          <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C).</li>
      <li>Season the short ribs generously with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or oven-safe pot over medium-high
        heat. Sear the short ribs on all sides until browned, about 2-3 minutes
        per side. Remove the ribs and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the onions, carrots, and celery to the pot. Cook until softened,
        about 5-7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the garlic and tomato paste, cooking for another 1-2 minutes
        until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deglaze the pot with red wine, scraping up any browned bits from the
        bottom. Simmer for 5 minutes to reduce slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the short ribs to the pot. Add the beef stock, rosemary, thyme,
        and bay leaves. Ensure the liquid covers the ribs about three-quarters
        of the way.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the pot with a lid and transfer it to the preheated oven. Braise
        for 2.5 to 3 hours, checking occasionally to ensure the liquid hasn’t
        reduced too much (add more stock if needed).
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the ribs are fork-tender, remove the pot from the oven. Discard the
        herb sprigs and bay leaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the short ribs hot, spooning the sauce over the top. Pair with
        mashed potatoes, polenta, or your preferred side dish.
      </li>
    </ol>
